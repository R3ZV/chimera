# Chimera

This project aims to determine the programming language used in a given input file
without relying on the file extension.

Supported languages:
- C++
- Java
- Rust

# Samples

This project includes scripts for data collection and the results obtained,
but not the projects themselves.
The projects used are listed in the References section.

The results of the data parsing are located at "chimera/data-parser/{language}_tokens.txt".
You can modify what tokens should be considered by modifying the file "chimera/data_parser/{language}_keywords.txt".

To use your sample data create a `cpp`, `rs` and `java` drectory inside "chimera/data-parser/samples",
your tree should look something like this:

TODO: add a view of the `tree` after the project is done.
